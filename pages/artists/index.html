    <p>Stephanie Dinkins is a transmedia artist & Mozilla Creative Media Awards
      alum who creates experiences that spark dialog about race, gender, aging,
      and our future histories. Her work in AI and other mediums uses emerging
      technologies and social collaboration to work toward technological
      ecosystems based on care and social equity. Dinkins’ experiences with and
      explorations of artificial intelligence have led to a deep interest in how
      algorithmic systems impact communities of color in particular and all of
      our futures more generally.</p>

    <p>Dinkins’ experiments with AI have led full circle to recognize the
      stories, myths, and cultural perspectives, aka data, that we hold and
      share form and inform society and have done so for millennia. She has
      concluded that our stories are our algorithms. We must value, grow,
      respect, and collaborate with each other’s stories (data) to build care
      and broadly compassionate values into the technological ecosystems that
      increasingly support our future.</p>

    <p>Dinkins teaches at Stony Brook University, where she holds the Kusama
      Endowed Chair in Art. Dinkins is a Schmidt AI 2050 Senior Fellow and LG_
      Guggenhiem Award winner named to Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential
      People in AI(2023), a United States Artist Fellow, Knight Arts & Tech
      Fellow Lucas Artists Fellow in Visual Arts, and a Mozilla Creative Awards
      awardee (2021). Additional supporters of Dinkins work include the Onassis
      Foundation, Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence,
      Creative Capital, Soros Equality Fellowship, Data and Society Research
      Institute Fellowship, Sundance New Frontiers Story Lab, Eyebeam, Pioneer
      Works Tech Lab, NEW INC, Blue Mountain Center; The Laundromat Project;
      Santa Fe Art Institute and Art/Omi.</p>

    <p>The New York Times featured Dinkins in its pages as an AI influencer.
      Wired, Art In America, Artsy, Art21, Hyperallergic, the BBC, Wilson
      Quarterly, and a host of popular podcasts have recently highlighted
      Dinkins’ art and ideas.</p>
